# Unix-like File System
Implemented a simple UNIX-like file system with a hierarchical directory structure.
Files and directories can grow and shrink, and you need to manage free disk space. 
Your file system will be able to allow users to browse the directory structure, create and delete new files and directories,etc. 
The functionality is similar to UNIX file systems, but permission control and user management are not included. 
Neither do we require concurrency or high performance of your file system.
